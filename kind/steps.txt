=1. First run bash node-0_startup.sh
2. Copy the NODE_INFO_DICT from driver/main (in local) and paste it at chaos.py (in remote)
3. now run start_workloads.py (this will run Phoenix after deploying the workloads..)
# For reuse purposes, keep the workloads if phoenix needs to be ran twice..
I purposedly, keep a gap between #3 and #4 because sometimes pods fail.. so 4 might need some manual intervention..
4. then create users (preferrably 1 to 10) --  this takes 2-3 mins
5. Now go into local and generate load (ensure that you log the generated load into some logfile) 
6. Run chaos.py but let some time pass to get to steady load..
7. After running chaos.py, phoenix will detect it and fix the cluster in sometime..(Phoenix runs only once -- have hardcoded it..)
8. Run parse_logs.py to see the utility and success rate curves for this run..
9. Cleanup using clean-up file..
